## Mirror Docs

When asked to "read in the docs for XYZ" you must read in `.mirror-docs/sitemap.txt`, then select the likely applicable paths based on the `:: <TITLE>` next to the paths. When you go to read in the relevant docs you have chosen, keep in mind those paths are relative to `.mirror-docs/markdown/`.

When asked to "pull down the docs for <url>", go ahead and run `uv run mirror_docs.py <url>`.
