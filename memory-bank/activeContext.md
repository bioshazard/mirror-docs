# Active Context: mirror-docs

## Current Work Focus

Initializing the memory bank, documenting the existing codebase, and updating the documentation to reflect the project's intention and design.

## Recent Changes

*   Created the initial set of memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps

*   Create the `progress.md` file.
*   Analyze the existing scripts (`00-mirror.sh`, `01-md.py`, `02-sitemap.sh`) in more detail.
*   Identify potential areas for improvement and refactoring.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   How to best structure the mirrored documentation for optimal searchability and navigability.
*   Which data sources to prioritize for mirroring.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Using Markdown for documentation.
*   Using Python for data acquisition and transformation.
*   Using shell scripts for automation.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   The project has a clear separation of concerns between data acquisition, transformation, and presentation.
*   The use of shell scripts for automation simplifies the deployment and maintenance processes.
