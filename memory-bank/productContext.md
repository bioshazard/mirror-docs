# Product Context: mirror-docs

## Why This Project Exists

This project aims to solve the problem of fragmented documentation. Developers often need to consult multiple sources to understand a system or technology, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.

## Problems It Solves

*   **Documentation Silos:** Consolidates documentation from various sources into a single, unified location.
*   **Accessibility:** Makes documentation easier to find and access.
*   **Maintainability:** Simplifies the process of keeping documentation up-to-date.

## How It Should Work

The system will function as a CLI tool (`mirror_docs.py`) that accepts a domain, documentation path, output directory, and sitemap file name as arguments. It will mirror the HTML content, convert it to Markdown, generate a sitemap, and store the results in the specified output directory.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should be able to easily find the information they need.
*   **Fast Search:** The search functionality should be quick and accurate.
*   **Consistent Formatting:** All documentation should have a consistent look and feel.
