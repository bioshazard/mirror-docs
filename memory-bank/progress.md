# Progress: mirror-docs

## What Works

*   Basic file structure and initial scripts are in place.
*   The project has a clear goal and scope.
*   The memory bank is being initialized.

## What's Left to Build

*   Refine the data acquisition process to ensure reliable mirroring of raw HTML documentation.
*   Optimize the HTML to Markdown conversion process for accurate and consistent results.
*   Ensure the sitemap generation process correctly indexes the local full-docs references.

## Current Status

The project is in the initial stages of development. The memory bank is being initialized to capture the current state of the codebase.

## Known Issues

*   The data acquisition and transformation components are not yet implemented.
*   The storage mechanism is not yet defined.
*   The presentation layer is not yet implemented.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   The decision to use Markdown as the primary format was based on its simplicity and wide support.
*   The decision to use Python for scripting was based on its rich ecosystem of libraries.
*   The decision to use shell scripts for automation was based on their simplicity and ease of use.
