# Project Brief: mirror-docs

## Core Requirements and Goals

*   **Project Name:** mirror-docs
*   **Goal:** To create a reusable Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that mirrors HTML documentation from a specified domain and path, converts it to Markdown, and generates a sitemap file.
*   **Scope:** The project will consist of a single Python CLI script (`mirror_docs.py`) that handles mirroring, conversion, and sitemap generation, configurable via command-line arguments. The previous shell and Python scripts will be removed.
