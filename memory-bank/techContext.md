# Technical Context: mirror-docs

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** Used for data acquisition and transformation scripts.
*   **Shell Scripting (Bash):** Used for automation and orchestration.
*   **Markdown:** Used as the primary format for storing and presenting documentation.
*   **pyproject.toml:** Used for managing Python project dependencies and build configuration.
*   **uv.lock:** Used for managing Python project dependencies.

## Development Setup

*   **Python Environment:** Requires a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed (see `pyproject.toml`).
*   **Shell Environment:** Requires a Bash-compatible shell environment.

## Technical Constraints

*   **Dependency Management:** Managing dependencies for Python scripts can be challenging.
*   **Data Source Variability:** Different documentation sources may require different acquisition and transformation strategies.

## Dependencies

*   Dependencies are managed using `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

## Tool Usage Patterns

*   **Text Editors:** Used for editing scripts and documentation.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Used for running scripts and managing the system.
